        <p> This link is one of my first projects creating a realistic encounter at your local DMV.</p>
        <p> For this project we used Java and created loops for every customer that and put the odds against them for getting their number for the DMV</p>

        <p> This is a link to one of my more recent projects that I worked on alongside my peers creating a marketplace for QU students.</p>
        <p> For this project me and and fellow classmates worked together to create a webiste using java that allowed students using their ids to buy and sell items on the store.</p>
        <p> My personal contribution to this assignmnet was the sell and cart methods that you can see if you visit the project.</p>
